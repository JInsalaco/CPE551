0,"Pre-COVID this place was ALWAYS packed and overflowing with people waiting outside for a seat. I had been hearing about this place for its cheap food, drinks, and free cotton candy so I was already hooked.I've only tried the okonomiyaki here and some beer after a bit of a wait but it was worth it for the vibe, decor, and prices. Did I also mention free cotton candy after your meal ?!",5,0.3,4
1,"What a great spot in East Village! Loved the interior of the restaurant when I saw the outside and loved it even more when I walked inside. It had such a cozy, casual feel. Although their menu was a bit overwhelming visually, it was fun to see all the photos of the food and know what to expect. There were a bunch of things I wanted to try. My friend I had ended up trying the fried squid legs (crunchy and tasty), salmon belly (not much seasoning/flavoring added, but it was fatty and satisfying), fried rice (the one with seaweed on top had a great variety of different ingredients), cow tongue (very good and more thinly sliced than I've typically seen), and eggplant (which my friend described as ""very clean""). We enjoyed every single dish and had a great time. At the end of the meal, they provided a small cup of cotton candy sugar, which we brought to the front of the restaurant to make our own cotton candy in the machine. So fun!Taste | 4-4.5Atmosphere | 5Presentation | 4Service | 3.5OVERALL | 4.5",5,0.23674948240165625,4
2,"This place is legit so cool. And it's so cheap too, both good and drinks. I can get like 3 cocktails for under $20...what a steal. The vibe and decorations inside are also great and weird. The music can make it seem like you're getting brainwashed to join some army but I'm down. The food is also fairly good for the price. I had Omurice and it was great...who doesn't like chicken fried rice along with egg :). Yum, definitely come back again to hang here but the tables/chairs are a bit small and no room since your legs are crammed up against the tables.",4,0.16,3
3,"Kenka is a lot of fun! If you walk around on St. Mark's Place, you can't miss it. Very popular with young people, probably because of the prices. This is supposed to be an authentic Izakaya, so you can pretend you're traveling. Before the pandemic, it was always very loud and crowded. The artwork and decor is really cool. Check out the red octopus and I'm not sure what's up with the mannequins. There's even Godzilla and Tokyo Tower on the menu! You will not find California rolls here. The menu has some really interesting things. Don't forget the cotton candy!",4,0.3277777777777778,4
4,"Another great Izakaya spot, similar to Udon West Midtown which we reviewed a few days ago.Highlights:- Open Late (4AM)- Best food prices (most items under $10)- Wide variety (endless ala carte options)- $1.50/glass for Asahi and Sapporo.  $8 pitchers.Lowlights:- Motsunabe is closer to a Dwaenjang Chige (Korean Miso Stew) than it is to a traditional Japanese nabe in terms of broth and ingredients.  We were disappointed to not know this prior to ordering.  Still a good dish, just inaccurate representation.- Very crowded if you dislike sitting shoulder to shoulder with other guests.- May be a wait time, as restaurant is overtly popular with the younger crowd.I'll briefly explain my thoughts on each dish we ordered.The Maguro Salad ($8) was a very uniquely prepared item.  It is reminiscent of Big City Diner's 'Ray Chan's Ultimate Poke' in Hawaii.  Slabs of maguro tuna over a bed of greens, dressed with a light sriracha and ponzu sauce.  Enough for 2-3 to share.The Ankimo ($7), or chilled monkfish liver, would be a close cousin to foie gras.  Not as fatty or difficult to stomach as its cousin.  Very flavorful with a savory profile, but not salty at all.  Topped with a dollop of tobiko flying fish roe and dressed in ponzu sauce.  Great as one of several appetizers for any table. Serves 1-4.The Karaage Chicken ($7) was as one would expect Japanese Fried Chicken to taste.  Meets all the stops an Izakaya goer expects: crunchy, served hot and fresh out of the deep fryer, signature mirin taste without being overpowering.  Single order serves 1-4.The Motsunabe ($29) was my most conflicted dish of the night.  I expected a Japanese style dashi broth but was not expecting a Korean miso stew.  Nothing else on the menu indicated that Kenka served Japanese-Korean fusion.  Still, the hot pot was prepared with fair portions of meat and veg, served on a tableside gas hot plate to keep warm throughout our meal.  If you are a fan of Korean soups like Dwaenjang Chige, Soondubu, or Kimchee Chige you will enjoy this selection.  Easily serves 3-6.  Comes as a large portioned item.Overall experience was fantastic.  Staff work as a team, service is speedy, and restaurant is clean.  Kenka sits on my toplist for late night, cheap alcohol Izakayas in Manhattan.",5,0.11723602484472051,3
5,"Kenka is a solid Japanese restaurant with a huge selection of low-priced, high quality food. There's no room to wait inside so it's probably best to put your name down and take a walk; this place can get really busy at night. If you arrive at 8pm during a weekday, you can expect a wait of about 30 minutes or so. Inside, the food comes pretty quickly; our server was attentive and nice. This place is good for ordering a ton of items, and that's what we did, so I'll just highlight my favorite and least favorite, though everything was good. Gyudon - This dish was awesome; the beef was so flavorful, mixed in with rice, onions, and green onions, and garlic. On its own, this is a pretty sizable dish; for $5.50, this is definitely a good item for lunch. I would definitely get this again, but there are so many thing to choose from that I would do myself a disservice getting the same thing next time. Onigiri - Kind of a cop-out. The rice balls were meh, but it's not a big deal because they're just... rice balls. These seem more like filler than anything else. I probably wouldn't get these again, especially with another dish that already has rice. Price: 5/5Quality: 4/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 4/5Atmosphere: 3/5One thing I didn't love was the tables, since my knees kept hitting the end; the tables are essentially boxes. You'll notice many people sitting (seemingly comfortably) at an angle.",4,0.29333333333333333,4
6,Last time was pre COVID. Went there yesterday. COVID measures in place. Couple tables outside and tables distanced apart inside. Got there about 530pm on a Saturday. Hostess said they opened at 5pm and have reopened about a month ago. Still cheap beer and good food. Gotta love the decor inside.,5,0.32,4
7,I really enjoy this place for the authentic Japanese experience! It's super affordable and the food always comes out hot and fresh. The staff is very friendly and is upholding Covid guidelines well. I can't wait to go back.,5,0.26979166666666665,4
8,"We visited Kenka couple times when my husband was in graduated school but weren't here for 3 years since you need to come to wait before they open at 6:00pm to get a table or wait for 1-2 hours in line. Their food was solid for Japanese izakaya with amazingly affordable price. We ordered 12 dishes for group of 6 people and only paid $25 each person. However, their service was horrible and reluctant. We tried to ask for some recommendation but the waiter kept ignoring our questions. It's really ridiculous that there were 6 tables still available but people waited outside at the same time. (We were the first group served so we didn't wait in line.)",2,-0.009259259259259238,3
9,"This Japanese izakaya on St Mark's place gets very busy very quickly so be prepared to wait outside to be seated. Interior is an interesting collage of Japanese bondage, reflection of traditional street side from the old days. Patrons should expect to see many sexual innuendos in the form of art which may be picture worthy or not. Food does get served quite quickly, there is a long list items on the menu.  Beers are served in a tower and you can ask for a larger beer cup if they serve you with half size mason jars. Servers are and not very keen on anyone that take up too long to order or, interrupt their walk way.It's a nice place to visit once since every one talks about it but, as the previous reviews reflect, lot more hype then quality for the money you pay.",3,0.1490196078431373,3
10,"Ugh, I am bit disappointed Location: saint mark street in east village is always the hype. Yeah, you can find a basement-like restaurant where there are always people waiting outside the room. Yeah, that's probably Kenka. It is famous for its ""interesting "" installation art along with some ""authentic "" Japanese foodFood: actually I am disappointed about the food. It's pricy, but not that good. The chicken skin is too hard to bite on and everything else is just bland.  I can't think of any other place tasting like this. It is a disaster. Service: average. They made you wait outside even thought there are plenty tables inside.Overall: I am being very nice and gave 3 stars. Hmm",3,0.00654761904761904,3
11,"Came here with some friends who moved to NYC and they suggested this place after I wanted to check out a place that you can't get in Seattle and ended up here. We got here right when it opened as they had quite a queue when we got there and got packed quickly. The menu is very vast and its almost too overwhelming to go through. I do love that they include images with some of the items which helps you select what you wanted to eat. The food here is cheap which makes you order more so you can try multiple things. We did it family style and everything was good. The imagery can be a bit off-putting if you're a prude but honestly it was pretty cool to me. Eat food, drink alcohol and be merry!",4,0.3319047619047619,4
12,"I've been coming to this place since my college days and it still remains really poppin with the young people! The staff and service is great here. I think the main reasons why young people love coming here is because of the vibes and the environment inside & the huge variety of alcohol that is relatively on the cheaper side. It's honestly the perfect spot to get lit with friends with DECENT food. That said, the reason why I give this place 3 stars because the food is pretty so-so to be honest. I've had the Okonomiyaki which came out dry and slightly burnt. The udon I had before - it tasted like any normal udon, but wasn't bad. The Karagae was sorta dry and flavorless..their ramen was average.Overall, I don't think the food is amazing at all, pretty meh to average. I honestly think they just have such a huge variety of alcohol and decent food plus a great environment to get lit with friends is the selling case of going here. If you're looking for a good dinner though - I would pass on this place tbh.",3,0.272,4
13,"Lots of people go to Kenka for late night snacks/beers. So we went here on NYE, the decoration of the place is fun and interesting. but they made us wait for 20-30 mins when there was 2-3 empty tables without explaining why. And their bathroom is just disgusting, always drunk people yelling, making too much noises. definitely not for date night or to talk. I would go another Yakidori place.",3,-0.11250000000000002,3
14,"This place is a little weird. The food was great and very cheap! The Miso Ramen was VERY buttery! The inside of the restaurant is different. There is a room in the back with creepy mannequins and there was one naked hanging from the ceiling.... A little weird....The 9 Pound Curry challenge is for ONE PERSON. There is a $25 fee if you do not finish.Also, the pink sugar they give you after your meal is for the cotton candy machine outside! Didn't realize till after we left",3,-0.022916666666666658,3
15,"My favorite restaurant in the east village and many more villages. The staff are always friendly, the wait times were always worth it. I am happy to know they have reopened because I missed them so much. I always have the tori no karaage, omurice, yakitori and yakimeshi (sorry if I mispelled, as I always mispronounce. :') ) Will be going back again soon, and possibly inviting my friends for a big table for my birthday in December. haha. Covid Measures are in place, they are well prepared for dining in, and distance is more than 6 feet. Very affordable and great taste.",5,0.2645833333333334,4
16,"Definitely a hole in the wall with authentic izakaya vibe. The extensive menu included some interesting choices (testicles anyone?) and the classics, including skewers, ramen, tonkatsu. Items are super cheap, but portions are small. 7 people, with about 3 bottles of sake and dinner, was about $400 after tax and tip (which was included automatically).They do not take reservations, even for large groups, so come early and leave your name. If you have time to kill, the store upstairs looked pretty intense and bizarre, so might be worth ogling for a few minutes? Plenty of bars nearby, too. We did not have any wait though on a Tue night at 7:30pm. The seats are small, low and crowded, so might not be the best for those with joint issues, and there are no good place to place our things except in a corner on the floor.",4,0.25357142857142856,4
17,"Five Stars for the $8 pitchers of Kirin!  What a great deal in nyc. The was a favorite place of mine during grad school and every time I come back, it brings back great memories.The food is good for the price you pay and it's really a steal considering this is Manhattan. A few of the selections we made- the takoyaki- these were most likely premade and heated up, but it still tastes pretty good- the gyoza tasted really gingery/garlicky- the okonomiyaki was what you'd expect, just a little bit on the small side-the chicken yakitori was well seasoned, just not as hot as I'd want it to be -The age dashi tofu was pretty good as wellWe ordered a bottle of the seasonal sake and it was pretty good!!Will definitely be back!",5,0.240625,4

19,"First of all, you don't come to Kenka for the food. You come here for the izakaya experience, ambience, and to just have a good time with your friends. I first found out about this place when I was a kid in high school and it's amazing to still see this place around with the cheap prices of their menu. It's truly a landmark of the St. Mark's area. This place does not accept reservations and it is by wait list only. Once you arrive, put your name down at the front and stand around until they call your name. You cannot put your phone number down so you will have to wait outside, but this waiting game is all part of the experience of Kenka and is actually a great marketing scheme because it generates a crowd in front of the place. At 8pm on a Saturday night for a party of 2, it took us 1.5 hours to get a table. Once inside, it's actually quite spacious with a bunch of tables spread out so you don't feel like you're on top of another party.I had the Modan yaki which is basically okonomiyaki except with the addition of noodles in it. It had a lot of sauce on it and tasted greasy, but I could imagine this would taste great if I was drunk at 2am. Same thing with the spicy raw tuna egg salad. The food here in general isn't bad, but isn't anything mind blowing. I would say the Russian roulette takoyaki was disappointing. It tasted exactly like those pre-made takoyaki you get from the freezer section in the market. However considering the prices of everything, it's a pretty good deal and you can't complain. Also note that at the time of this review, they have a C grade for food safety/sanitation.",4,0.15615384615384614,3
20,"Kenka feels like an authentic Japanese restaurant (but I honestly wouldn't know the difference because I've never been) BUT I would imagine that it would and could look and taste like japan. Their menu is enormous and diverse. The food is tasty and comes out fast. Try the frog, it's crispy! I also loved the tuna and fried oysters. The only reason for the 4 stars is because of the wait. We got there right as they opened on a Saturday and waited over 1 hour! We were right about to give up up when they finally called us. This is definitely a spot to see in NYC!",4,0.2571428571428571,4
21,"Visited Kenka for the first time around 9:45pm yesterday and it was lively.My wife, friends, and I wanted Japanese food and we visited Kenka. When we arrived, there was a lot of people standing around waiting for their names to be called. We were excited because that usually means the food is good? We put our names down, 30-40 mins passed and we were ushered to our table. When we entered and sat down, I immediately knew this wasn't a 'restaurant' lol. It was an izakaya or casual Japanese pub. We stayed, ordered our pitcher of Sapporo, and a bunch of dishes to share amongst the table. My favorite was the okonomi yaki (Japanese pancake). The $8 dollar pitcher was a good deal too.My two cents, although the food wasn't bad, don't come here expecting the best Japanese food in all of Manhattan. Come here for the experience, the ambience, and a good time with cool people.",4,0.24140625000000002,4

There are options that vary in ""exotic"" value, so you can bring your foodie friends as well as your plain pasta type friends and still have everyone able to find something on the menu. They have great beer deals and all the menu items are priced extremely reasonably so this place won't break the bank. The wait can get long and the process to get In can seem confusing, but just add your name to the sheet outside of the door and you will eventually be called.

Their other menu has more interesting choices for people who like interesting foods such as worm fried rice.It's hard for me to suggest a plate so I would recommend trying a little of everything. I do love the sashimi combo! I came here with another person and we ordered around 7 dishes, more than a typical pair would eat.

Once inside the restaurant is dark with some funky/ fun Japanese decor.

We ask for a replacement and it came back with not fully cooked again. The takoyaki was frozen and it was microwave since the middle was hot and the outer part was cold. The yakotori was cooked but only 1 side of it was glazed and it tasted bland. The curry is watered downed and the pork was not fresh must be frozen.

There was a wait but we just ended up walking around for a bit till our table was ready. It has a really great divey atmosphere, great for late night meal and drinks. The service was really really bad but we were already a few drinks in so we were okay with patiently waiting. Took about 20+ minutes after we sat to get an order in, and the waitress took our drink orders and left immediately even though I was still ordering...Was going to put in our food order as well but okay. We waited another 10-15 minutes to flag someone for our food order. I'm a pretty aggressive flagger so it was a tough situation. The menu's were hilarious and creative. Take the time to read them and you will get a laugh that will keep you busy while you wait to flag someone down. I honestly love this style of art and vibe. Reminds me of the times I visited Japan.Once the drinks started flowing and food started coming out all was good. The food was of amazing quality for a divey looking place. Everything was well prepared and intricately delicious. My absolute favorite was the employee bento. It was ""a surprise"" so we didn't know what we were getting but we were told this is what the employees were being fed that night for dinner. Those lucky bastards. It was so buttery and soft.. the rice was seasoned and cooked PERFECTLY. The bukkake cold udon was very pretty and interesting to eat. So any flavors erupting in your mouth (bc I like to mix things), buy maybe better not to mix it up haha.Cotton candy sugar is given at the end so you can make your own cotton candy outside.

Make sure to come early and put your name down for a table because it gets super busy around dinner time. Later at night you can get seated pretty quickly. Also, the interior (and even the menu) is X-rated so just be aware before bringing your friends and family here LOL. The menu has a very large selection of drinks and Japanese dishes to choose from and they're all pretty cheap, I don't think I've ever spent more than $20 here. I always get the tako wasabi, karaage, fries, curry udon, or ramen. The ramen is very mediocre and doesn't have much flavor but I can't complain since it's $5. A lot of people come here to share the beer tower ($30) with friends, but I just stick with the $1.50 Sapporo. Overall, it's a fun place to go with friends or for a date night since you can order several dishes and share, for a reasonable price.

35,"Eh, okay so was SUPER hyped for this place after passing it and its LONG lines everyday on my way home from work. Finally decided to try it when some friends came to visit, and sadly, the food did not live up to expectations. To sum it up, it was predominantly Japanese classics on a tapas menu. Lots of meats, seafood, ramen, and rice dishes to choose from, so the options were plentiful. We ordered the fried chicken appetizer (best thing we had), Okonomiyaki (seafood pancake),  Omurice (fried rice in an omelet), a curry udon (eh, too salty), and takoyaki (not bad). Everything was OK, especially for the dirt cheap prices, but overall just too salty and some things honestly were over-sauced, overpowering the natural tastiness of the actual food being served. However, good prices for both the food and drinks (the Asian beers were *the move*). The setup was also really fun -- it's like we entered a secret world lost in the midst of East Village. Would recommend as a one-time stop when looking for a new happy hour environment with friends for the sake of value in price, but not to rave about the food itself.

36,"Came here for dinner. After seeing Dr. Yamada's post of weird and exotic food items, I choose to come. In the front of the pub, there is a list where people will write down their name as the establishment is served on a first-come-first-serve basis.When I entered, it was colorful as it is decorated with posters. While I went to the restroom, I heard some music that resembles the Kagawa folk song Konpira Funefune 金比羅船々. In the restroom, I saw that there are graffiti in Japanese, where one said ""Kenka daisuki.""Ordered the Makanai, Kaeru no Karaage, Bull's Penis, Motsuni, and Tonsoku. The Makanai resembles the Korean Hoe-deopbap raw fish bibimbap. I had to mix it up as the wasabi is at the bottom. Eating the Kaeru was a metaphor of the episode where Ash releases Greninja to save Kalos from the roots.The majority of the weird and exotic items weren't available, so I end up choosing items that I don't eat frequently in Japanese cuisine. From where I was sitting, I was able to see the kitchen, where I was able to see several okonomiyaki being grilled. The okonomiyaki are always in Osaka style, where the ingredients are mixed up, unlike the Hiroshima style, where the ingredients are layered.I was able to see the mannequins and Ultraman by the restrooms. Come to think of it, the Gen Y, which I am from, are used to Megaman and Pokemon. If I ever become an enka singer-songwriter and rokyoku recitalist, I would usually put on a kimono, instead of a suit. When I make my Megaman debut, I would rather put on a dark-blue kimono with Megaman.exe with his daisho wielding an electrified katana. My Pokemon kimono consists of the titular Pokemon colors with the titular Pokemon in its signature pose. My enka pseudonym will be Shin'ichi Yanagawa 梁川新一 while my rokyokyu pseudonym will be Heihachi Minami 三波平八. To see my anime enka, go to pixiv.net/member.php?id=…, if you can understand Japanese.If I ever become Saburo Kitajima's disciple and/or work at Nintendo as a spokesperson/marketeer, I would expect to be in bars like this one where I would be guzzling beer and sake with my colleagues.",5,0.11289592760180997,3

The menu seems to go on forever; they have everything from grilled meats and fish to ramens and udons to curries and other Japanese classics. Everything is priced very inexpensively; a couple can easily eat and drink their fill for less than $50. Everything comes out very quickly, and while there can be a line to get in, you won't spend a lot of time eating here if you don't want to. I will caution everyone, there are quite a few different naked images/effigies scattered around the restaurant, so if you are planning on bringing young kids, keep that in mind.

(Just like Japan!) I just wish the seats were a little comfier.Service:The service here could definitely better. I'm assuming that it's slow mostly because of the sheer volume of people that are there all the time on weekends. I also wish the food came out faster, but it's probably slow for the same reasons. They're always bustling in the kitchen.Food:The food may not be as good as Japan, but it definitely made me reminiscent of Japan. They have a WIDE variety of dishes to choose from and try out. Try everything! Don't expect anything too extravagant or super filling. Izakaya is meant to be shared and not too heavy, but you can probably still get full from spending $25. The beers are only $1, which is a HUGE plus for the parties!",4,0.11003787878787877,3
40,"I ordered the Bull Penis and after an hour it never came. The penis that never came.I never understood the appeal, other than the $8 pitchers. The decor and bull penis are provocative but outside of squeamish novelty, the food's nothing special. I have mixed feelings about the service. The waitresses are nice but really apathetic to your orders. I was with a table of 4 and the food would come out 15 minutes apart. And that's for the food that came. I'm still looking for my penis.Anywho, it's not a big deal.There was this one instance where my friend came later and they wouldn't let him sit because we didn't specify the exact number of guests. Sure fine whatever, there maybe some policy where blah blah blah, but I don't see much of a concern since there was literally an extra unused seat right next to us. That part wasn't so bad. What sucked was that this was like an hour and a half in and I'm still waiting for my bullpenis. After my friend left because they wouldn't seat him, they gave us our checks and autocancelled my penis request. It was more than likely they just weren't cooking it. Or I like to think there was a live cow in the back that they were struggling to castrate. But whatever, I'm an adult and could afford to go somewhere else where the pitcher is slightly more money.At regular intervals, they play marching audio, so taking a shit feels a lot like being in an internment camp.

We ordered the fried octopus (around $8), udon noodles ($5), toro sashimi (around $8), and katsu don (around $8). The food was filling and affordable. I would highly recommend this place for those who prefer fried Japanese food. One thing to note is that wait time can be very long. We arrived just half an hour after the the restaurant's opening hour (6 PM), and we waited almost an hour. Upon arrival, it's important to sign in.

42,"Kenka is definitely a solid spot for college students. Super casual vibes and it's underground so it seems somewhat hipster. The prices of all the dishes range from 8-12$ and packs a punch. I usually get the takoyaki as appetizer but we got this meat on a stick. Forgot the name but wasn't worth ordering again. I ordered the gyu don bowl and the fried rice. To be honest, wasn't that stellar. Definitely could get better options elsewhere. If I were to give any advice or suggestion, I think the curry rice dishes with tonkatsu or hamburger steak are worth giving a try. The highlight of the spot was being able to make our own cotton candy sticks given to us after the meal. Also, this place is a great spot to grab a pitcher of beer and split it with friends. Didn't do that this time but have done it previously. Love coming here more for the vibes than food!",3,0.2564102564102564,4

We decided to order the usual and although the prices are consistent, the food unfortunately is not. The good:-Yakitori Combination: Barbecued very nicely and all of the meats were tender. -Takoyaki: Good amount of octopus, crispy exterior, fluffy interior, and generous condiments.-Beer: Nothing much to say, alcohol here is cheap.The bad:-Service: Waitress was rude. Hostile to us when we went in. Intentionally ignored us when we asked for the bill so we had to get another waitress. I always give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to service because I've worked in the food industry before so I understand that it can get busy. But this time was too hard to ignore. Not to mention we went right during opening and were one of the first ones to get seated so I don't know what could be angering her. Even when things were tough for me outside of work I never let it reflect in my attitude and make sure to respect my customers so I expect the same respect from others.-Everything else we ordered: Everything else was noticeably lacking in seasoning, flavor, texture, or a combination of both. We ordered stir fried udon, fried rice, karage, pork katsu, bbq squid, okonomiyaki, and kimchi pork. I can usually dismiss the poor service if the food can make up for it, but unfortunately it didn't and therefore I won't be returning again.Phil's 5-ScaleAmbience/Setting - 1/1Service - 0/1Food - 1/3Total - 2/5",2,0.025257936507936507,3

I just come here to eat, drink, and have a great time.The food and drinks here are pretty cheap considering the location. The food itself...is just decent. The ramen broth lacked depth in flavor. The takoyaki here is just okay. Among everything I would probably recommend the yakitori (skewers) and the chicken karage (fried chicken). Their katsu is pretty good too.

Yakitori combo platter (3/5): this is good to share and try a bit of everything from octopus to chicken to pork. I'd say the chicken was the best as the other skewers tasted too dry or overcooked. 2. Yaki Soba (4/5): also shared this since it was a good amount of food and really hit the spot with the right amount of sauce and noodle texture.

The drink menu was also great and the quality of the food was actually very good for the pricing.

My friends and i got seated immediately when we went on a Tuesday night AFTER the entire party arrives. So make sure your entire party is present if you don't want to wait.Once I opened the menu I saw that there were not many healthy options. A lot of items looked like they were fried or drizzled in so much sauce and butter. The good thing about the menu is that they have pictures, but the pictures were overwhelming to my eyes because they were all a shade of brown/beige due to all the fried carby foods they have. The prices for the food were also marked and the prices are pretty cheap but take up 1/4 of the picture of the food so sometimes you couldn't see the picture of the food itself that well. I ordered the Japanese pancake, green tea ice cream, hotate, and the buttered mushrooms. All I can say is I feel pretty MEH about all the food I ordered. The pancake was covered in too much sauce and was mushy.The green tea ice cream tasted like it was sweetened artificially and was too soft in my option and I enjoy more hard serve items. The scallops were so small in portion and overcooked. The buttered mushrooms were good but a bit burnt.I do not suggest getting the actual food here, my friends who got beers enjoyed their beers.The chairs are also very small.

But this recent experience had us never to return here ever again. 1) sanitation in this restaurant is terrible, gnats were everywhere and one fell into my friends sake 2) I Ordered the tonkatsu with fried rice and the restaurant said they will make it as a special order, which I really appreciate the effort of going that far for me. However when the food came, i smelt this nasty foul fish scent from the fried rice and that was a red flag. I took one bite and I knew the seafood was rancid when they cooked it; called the waiter to see if they could take it out from our bill but he said he can't since it was a special order and he can't do anything about it. That's fine if he can't do anything but we want a clearer explanation because the food literally made me nauseous and I ate the fried rice dish before and it's just not up to my expectations this time. We are willing to pay for the whole bill it's just we want to see if it's an option to take off one order that was bad (8 dollars off our bill) we spoke to the manager about it and he straight up called us rude for not paying for the food that they made an effort to make. First of all, we never said we are not paying, we just wanted Clarification and if they could do anything else for us since the food was bad. There's a difference between making an effort and actually making something good. The manager blamed me for not knowing the food has so much sodium and therefore I was nauseous but how the hell were we supposed to know that? He later stood up and said this conversation is over and he has work to do. There were only 4 tables left at the restaurant and there are less than 8 customers left.  Kenka has a reputation of losing customers because of their terrible customer service but this time they be going to lose a lot more because we are never coming back and don't ever expect anyone of our friends to come either.

58,"I live right around the area, and I've walked across the street where Kenka is located multiple times. I've never noticed it because you need to take a couple of steps downstairs to enter the restaurant and its English name isn't located anywhere on the outside, but my out of town friends wanted to come. First impression: this entire restaurant is decorated with pornography. They even have this glass room inside the restaurant with mannequins posed in overly sexual positions. Very interesting. We had to wait nearly 35 minutes for our turn, but the weather was nice, and my friends and I enjoyed sitting on the bench outside and chatting while waiting for our turn. The food is pretty cheap, and the menu is insane. I got a headache from trying to read the menu because they have over 40 items on each page with pictures to match. I could tell that the food wasn't going to be that good, and I wasn't that hungry, so I let my friends order a couple of items for the entire table. The alcohol is also ridiculously cheap for New York. My friends ordered the huge beer tower, which was about $38, but it's cheaper to order 4 pitchers ($8 each). A pint of Japanese beer is about $1.50. I'm not a beer or hard liquor girl, so I ordered two cocktails: peach Calpico and mango Calpico. Both were really good. I couldn't even taste the alcohol, but I could definitely feel the alcohol after finishing one glass. The food...is honestly not great. I wasn't expecting anything either, but it managed to lower my expectations. I believe we ordered sausages, pork belly, seafood pancake, and some other things, but I can't even remember because all the food was so mediocre. The pork belly was so dry and difficult to chew. We expected the sausages to be Asian sausages, but they're literally American hot dogs. The seafood pancake wasn't bad, and I actually enjoyed the crunchy texture of the cabbage. I don't really think people come here to eat, but nonetheless I had fun drinking and talking anyways. It's an interesting vibe. The chairs are extremely uncomfortable and tiny, and it bothers me that they don't have space for your legs to fit underneath the table.

This one star review is for what happened when we ventured inside this place.Our server for some reason thought that she can give us all the attitude and rude service (Server name was Nozomi).

I had to ask one more time what's happening with our food, she said ""I can't guarantee when your food is coming out"". Seriously girl, 50 mins into order you still don't know what is happening in the kitchen and on top of it instead of apologizing you give us an attitude for inquiring about our food.(Red Flag 2)Finally food came out, my rice though advertised as fried rice with chicken had not even a single piece of meat. Food was just mediocre.Coming to cheque, I obviously did not tip her because of her rude unprofessional service. She was the audacity to follow us outside the restaurant and ask us why we did not tip her...when I told her she was rude her reply was ""IT'S BUSY TODAY""...just because it's peak time at the restaurant you can be rude???...this server definitely needs a crash course in hospitality.She said also said don't ever come back to this restaurant.

We did not have to wait in a line and were seated right away. You will be overwhelmed by the variety on the menu. There are just so much food to choose from. We first were awed at its cheapness because it's about 1.5 times cheaper than normal dining price. We ordered sashimi deluxe, yaki onigiri, and katsu curry. The katsu curry was good. I would rate it as just average. The yaki onigiri was bland because the rice was a bit dry. There are two onigiris served when u order one serving, but we only had one of them. I have a lot to say about the sashimi deluxe but I'll just say that it's very fishy and room temperature. I never stop moving my chopsticks in front of sashimi but I put down my chopsticks after trying a few pieces. If my friends were reading this, they would know this says a lot about the food.We ordered additionally cheese harumaki and yakitori deluxe. Honestly, the cheese harumaki was the best out of all. It was cheesy and moderately salty. We were full when the yakitori deluxe was served but we had to try a few pieces because a couple of our friends recommended the menu. However, we spat out half of them because it was smelly, greasy, and oily. ESPECIALLY the meatball yakitori. I would recommend feeding it to ur friend as a prank. Other than that, the service was moderate. When we went out for a smoke, they placed napkins above our beer glasses to prevent dust.

There are a bunch on that block.  I feel they're all the same.  But this place has their own gift shop right upstairs.  They're the only Yakitori  place that has a self-serving cotton candy machine.  People really don't know how to use that thing.  It gets all messy there.  The wait for this place is ridiculous.  My party of 3 waited 2 hours.  Good thing I drove there.  My BF brought his book.  Aside from the wait, the food service definitely made up for it.  The place is super crowded once inside and the tables and chairs are not comfortable.  But who cares?  LOL  I was there to eat!The art up front was that of lewd content...but hey, so is that entire block!  There aren't any little kids around anyhow, so I didn't care.  It was cool!What we ordered:- dumplings- eel on rice- chicken skins x2- Octopus balls x2- fried egg- gyoza- noodle dishes (I forgot the name, but there will be pix)- at the end they gave us cotton candy sugar - (not pictured) 2 beersIt's a great experience.  I definitely recommend.  Make sure you show up at a good time to sign in at the front.  They don't take RSVPs.  First come, first serve type of situation.",4,0.25780075187969925,4
75,"It was a long wait at Kenka.For a group of 6 people for dinner we waited approximately an hour and half at the nearby Irish pub waiting to be seated, we checked our RSVP occasionally to make sure that our names were not skipped.It seems like an 'Izakaya meets Dive Bar' type of restaurant to me with choices of either tower of Sake or beer. The food choices are almost limitless, from grilled Japanese BBQ, Ramen, Sushi and Sashimi, some of Japan's classic favorites. All our food choices were delicious and served fresh.The service is efficient and the staff are helpful, they even provided a birthday candle for our friend celebrating that day, plus 1 star for that!Although it was a fun night and the dishes were good served in a timely fashion, I found the place to be a little loud, crowded and tight and I may prefer somewhere a little quieter to satisfy my Izakaya cravings next time.",4,0.12331932773109244,3
76,"Wow! The perfect way to describe this place: Sensory Overload. Straight off the bat, there are definitely a lot unique aspects of Japanese culture that you will see. The wait was not bad, had a table of 6. The food itself is great! The menu was a strucutred but a little hard to read given the vast amount of dishes that they offered. Would want to come back and other dishes! Wasabi Octopus: Very unique, very strong presence of wasabi as expected. The sashimi octopus was very tasty, had a good bite Okonomiyaki: This was very good. Exactly what one would expect out of an okonomiyaki. Sashimi Moriawase: DELICIOUS. If you love sashimi, definitely get this dish. This dish includes three different types of tuna, mackerel and tuna. I loved each fish, they were all of good quality.  Omurice: The omurice was very good. After I finished my plate, I wanted another order of the omurice. Unfortunately, the egg wasn't over easy and you can't cut it like you would normally. But the taste was amazing and left you wanting more",4,0.2645833333333334,4
77,"My friends and I came a couple minutes after it opened.  You have to sign your name on a list at the front of the door.  We waited about 5 minutes to be seated. The salmon and fatty tuna sashimi were my favorite.  My friends and I also ordered the yakitori platter.  I like the pork belly and the chicken.  The squid was too chewy and the chicken meatballs weren't as good.  I had a whiskey cocktail moved with soda and grapefruit that I really liked. The menu had a variety of exotic food to try (ex. Pork brain, bull penis, etc).  The pricing for the food is cheap here which is nice but the flavor is so-so to good.The chairs are small and short here.  And my knees hit the table if I sat forward so I had to sit sideways on the chair (haha).  The decor inside and the menu are very...interesting.  It is a mixture of vintage posters and knickknacks from different time periods.  It even has old Japanese pinball(?) games near the bathroom on display.",3,0.09705882352941175,3

It's huge. Will come back at one point to try the food.There's weird decorations and a side room that almost looks like there's a chamber with odd Japanese costumes and a chair that people can be strapped to...I have no idea what it's for, maybe they perform acts every now and then in that room?",5,0.09345238095238097,3

As for the food, there's lots of options ranging from noodle soups, donburi, yakitori, ""tapas"", and so forth. The food is very average and the price is overall low, but on par considering the portion size. The best part is you get to make cotton candy at the end!",3,0.24642857142857144,4
80,"Really not a fan of this place. We came by here because it was the only place that service omurice. We waited a little bit because the place was packed but we didn't mind. Once seated, we had a rude waitress and only one or two out of 5 dishes we ordered was good. I liked my zaru soba and my cousin got an udon soup I think, which she liked. Two people at our table got ramen that they just didn't end up eating because it wasn't good. The omurice was terrible. It came with a cream sauce. Since when is omurice served with a cream sauce? It also came way after all the rest of the food came. We were celebrating an occasion and brought a cake in and were serving it ourselves when our waitress came and told us to put it away because no outside food was allowed. I understand the rule but boy was she rude about it. Extremely expensive cost for not a good meal with crap service and extremely loud atmosphere. I get that they're trying to go for a certain look and maybe we just got unlucky but I have no idea why they have so many patrons.",1,0.07667410714285713,3
81,Fun place and yummy food! It takes forever to get seated so be prepared to wait. They have little baskets for your bags and purses while you're seated. Food is very affordable and well worth the price. I tried the bull penis-- fun to say I've eaten but wouldn't do it again. It's like eating fat and cartilage with sauce. Omurice was too sweet and ketchupy for my friend but still good for me as a solid sweet tooth. Don't forget to twirl your stick while making the cotton candy!,4,0.2640625,4
82,"As I was meeting a friend who was a local for dinner, I asked him to choose a place for dinner and he picked Kenka.  I arrived about 30 minutes early so I walked over to Chipotle to grab a Coke Zero Fountain Drink which is apparently quite the commodity in NY.  When he arrived we walked over to the restaurant only to find out there was a clip board there you had to put your name on as that's how they handled the line.  At this point, we were now third or fourth in line, so the wait wasn't to bad.  The hostess would come out and grab one group, take them inside and seat them, and then come back to get the next group.  Not a process I'm unfamiliar with, but in eighteen degree weather it can be a little off-putting.  I let my friend do most of the ordering so I'm not 100% sure what all we had, but we sampled quite a few dishes.  The Rice Balls were surprisingly good as I didn't expect that much flavor.  The Gyouza Teishoku were particularly good, but I am partial to dumplings.  The platter of skewered meats was a great sampler option and it allowed us to try the chicken, meatballs and various other meats on a stick.  Also, they had Kimchi Pickles, so huge win.  From a food perspective I thought the place was great; however, the pace was definitely rushed by the serving staff and after they cleared our plates they came by and asked us to leave so they could free up a table.  I can understand expediency, and I hate just hanging out a table when lots of people are waiting.  In this case, we were asked to clear the table immediately as the check was paid and there really wasn't much of a line outside.",2,0.13194444444444445,3
83,"From its electrically colored menu to its phallic cardboard cutout out front to the free shot of cotton candy that comes out with the bill, Kenka is definitely the place to go when you want to get freaky with dinner. If you have ten or fifteen minutes to kill while waiting for a table, I recommend browsing Search and Destroy above - you might find a hidden gem like a banana hammock with googly eyes or a hentai sweater.My final thoughts on Kenka: come for the soba, stay for the beer tower. Because life's short so you might as well get freaky with it",5,0.004761904761904765,3
84,"Although Kenka is master of the marketing game, making a name for itself with cheap eats and drinks and raunchy wall art, the gimmicks do not beget a dining experience hospitable to all visitors. Specifically, if you are vegetarian expect to be treated with condescension, derision, and indeed outright dismissal. I had the spine to ask a server if they had any vegetarian options and she responded with some of the most disgusted, even offended attitudes I have seen from the many unhappy servers in New York. While I can imagine this was a unique situation where the server was exhausted or dealing with other stresses, I have a feeling the restaurant neither wishes to accommodate vegetarians nor welcomes their business. The lack of any suitable options leads me to this supposition.If you eat vegetarian, unless you are satisfied subsiding on a meal of edamame and Sapporo (a beautiful combination lacking in essential food groups), stay away from this overhyped tourist trap.",1,0.08652597402597403,3
85,"There is honestly nothing special about this place other than cheap food and cheap drinks. This place is always crowded with a line and it's prob because the service here is sooo slow. The food here is hit or miss. I tried multiple things on the menu and I thought the takoyaki roulette was fun and one of the better tasting items. The yakitori combination skewer sticks were terrible and over priced. My favorite thing about this place was the free cotton candy powder they gave us. They give it to you after you pay for your meal, so don't forget to take it with you on your way out. Come here if you're looking for a cheap place to hang out, but I personally would not wait in line for this place for more than 15 minutes.",3,0.1967032967032967,3

Japanese friends of mine are also baffled on its popularity. The food leaves a lot to be desired.

89,"The food was average, but the atmosphere was unique with very exotic images, so I decided to give this place 4 stars.We got there at 5:50 PM - 10 mins before they opened, and we still had to wait like half an hour. (There were lots of open tables inside, but still they took their leisure time to sit waiting parties one by one).There were a lot of adultery images, on the menu and walls. The outdoors ""garden"" was decorated with some sex dolls, with one wearing a long-nosed tengu mask.Onto the food:-Toro sushi: wasn't good. Worse, it didn't taste fresh, and tasted nothing like ""toro"" - which was supposed to be tuna fat belly cut.-mackerel: was a-ok.-fried frog: nothing special.-bacon wrapped asparagus: a-ok-fried fatty salmon: a-ok-curry soba: a-ok-omurice (egg wrapped fried rice): a-okOverall the food was pretty average.

The menus can be confusing so do some research before coming.

I want to point out that this place is really busy and packed and wouldn't expected to get the best service possible when they don't have enough waiters to cover the entire restaurant.Don't expect to walk in and expect a seat, the wait is usually 30 mins to an hour to be seated at night. But once you're seated, you will noticed an interesting interior design and small wooden chairs. The set up reminds me a few spots in Japan I have been too and the food and drinks are pretty cheap in Kenka. I've had their fries, fried chicken, all their skewers and have not been disappointed. The only thing I would stay away from are their noodles which lacks flavor or it is too salty. If you're going their with friends for a few drinks, then definitely get the beer tower. It is considerably cheap and they have a great sake collection.

97,"Japanese izakaya, serving authentic? Japanese food. From takoyaki to fried frogs, you name it, it's here. Looks like the servers are all Japanese also.The overall cleanliness of the restaurant is definitely not top-notch. Perhaps because the restaurant itself is slightly underground, it does require better ventilation.Especially if you were to be seated far inside of the restaurant where the dishes are being washed... Or the food is being disposed. The smell is quite distracting.It seems that if you were to drink, then you are likely to be seated far inside, if not, you'll sit near the entrance.As a lover of Japanese cuisine, I've experienced much better customer service elsewhere. The staffs here seem ""in control"" of their customers; it does not feel welcoming at all. More like doing business with them by eating here.The table of 4 ordered 3 ramen noodles, and the last one came at the end of the meal. Everyone watched as I attempted to finish the bowl. The waitress was not sympathetic; it was more like she didn't know the concept of an entree how it should be served together if people were dining together at a table, nor did she apologize for any inconvenience, just advised to wait since the kitchen is super busy.They definitely have great deals on beers, so it might be a good idea dropping by to have a beer or two with something fried.Any sort of sushi or raw meat handling, I would highly suggest that you kill your cravings elsewhere. Another thing about customer service here, they seem careless of customer opinions. As 6 years experience in waitress, I'd be curious if someone left a dish untouched, regardless of the price of the dish.For desserts, they give you this little plastic sauce bowl with colored sugar, so that you can make a cotton candy at a machine outside of the restaurant. Interesting and fun, perhaps more fun if you're drunk.Anyways, I am definitely sure that it would not be my choice to drop here for any meals. Unless it was a social gathering and I was being dragged here without a choice..[Tips for parents]The menus includes 19+ material.

98,"I've been here a couple of times and this review reflects the most recent experience. The 3 of us got here a quarter to 6 on a Friday which is when they open and I put my name down. This is the trick. You gotta get here early or you'll end up getting lost in the crowd waiting to get in. (Alternatively, you can come here super late and avoid the wait.)We got tuna bone, Russian Roulette (6 dumplings one of which is filled with wasabi), okonomiyaki, beer tower, and fried tofu. Everything was delicious except for the fermented soybeans (natto) which I don't think is meant to taste good lol. It was my first time having the tuna bone - apparently they only have like two a day and it's sold out by 8pm according to my BF. For $5 you're basically eating sashimi, it's a win-win situation. Service was great considering how busy they were. They checked up on us occasionally and food came quickly. The place is clean and not too cramped (unless you're sitting all the way in the back by the restrooms). I can understand the grievances due to long wait, but the place is popular, what can you do but to get there early? It's no different than waiting for brunch at a popular spot. Anyway, if you're on St. Marks on the weekend and want to come here, best get here before it opens and put your name down. If not, then go somewhere else.",5,0.2714743589743589,4
